What is Docker?
Docker is a platform around creating and running containers
Docker Platform(Docker Hub, Docker Client, Docker Server, Docker Machine, Docker Images, Docker Compose)

Why use Docker?
Docker makes it really easy to install and run Sofware without worrying about setup or dependencies

Installing Docker for Windows Home users
-----------------------------------------
If you are a Windows Home user, you will not be able install the Docker for Windows Desktop edition, as it requires Hyper-V virtualization. This is supported only by Windows Professional and Enterprise editions.

Windows Home users will need to install Docker Toolbox which uses VirtualBox instead.

Docs and setup info available here:
https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/

Release downloads available here:
https://github.com/docker/toolbox/releases

Toolbox will install everything you need including VirtualBox.

You may also need to enable virtualization in your computer's BIOS settings. This will be different for each manufacturer, please refer to their documentation on which keys to use to access these settings on reboot.

After Toolbox is finished installing, open the Docker Quickstart Terminal. This will complete the setup and provision your VirtualBox machine.

Check your install:

In the Docker QuickStart terminal

docker run hello-world

This should pull down the test container and print hello-world to your screen.

*Note*

A major difference between the course lecture using Docker Desktop vs. Docker Toolbox is that you will not be able to use localhost anymore.

Instead, you will need to access your machine with the IP address 192.168.99.100

Installing Docker on Linux
---------------------------
These steps listed below are for Ubuntu Desktop 18 LTS. You can find the full official docs and steps for other Linux distributions here:

Ubuntu: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/

Fedora: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/fedora/

CentOS: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/

Debian: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/

Installing Docker

The Docker docs suggest setting up a Docker repository to install and update from.

This is where you should start:

https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#set-up-the-repository

After completing the installation steps, test out Docker:

sudo docker run hello-world

This should download and run the test container printing "hello world" to your console.

Installing Docker Compose

Unlike the Mac and Windows Docker Desktop versions, we must manually install Docker Compose. See the instructions for the installation steps (Click on the tab for Linux)

https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose

After completing, test your installation:

docker-compose -v

This should print the version and build numbers to your console.

Run without Sudo

Follow these instructions to run Docker commands without sudo:

https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user

The docker group will likely already be created, but you still need to add your user to this group.

Start on Boot

Follow these instructions so that Docker and its services start automatically on boot:

https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/#configure-docker-to-start-on-boot
