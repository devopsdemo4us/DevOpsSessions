Install and Setup the Docker client in your workstation

First search the available jenkins containers in docker hub
  docker search jenkins
 
Choose the container and pull it from the Docker hub
  docker pull jenkins

After pull please verify whether the images exists in your workstation
  docker images

Next, run a container using this image and map data directory from the container to the host; e.g in the example below /var/jenkins_home from the container is mapped to jenkins/ directory from the current path on the host. Jenkins 8080 port is also exposed to the host as 49001.
  docker run -d -p 49001:8080 -v $PWD/jenkins:/var/jenkins_home:z -t jenkins/jenkins

Now check the container is running or not
  docker ps
  
If it is running means go to the browser and hit the below url
  localhost:8080

Entering in to the docker container with bash
>docker exec -it jenkins bash
>cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
copy the code and paste in the unlock page in your browser
>exit
